@Calvin_United I'm voting November 3rd. I will not be a part of voter fraud. Too much can and will happen to early voting ballots. Fact is this, Democrat Politicians and DNC will do anything to make sure President Trump does not win reelection. With Soros DNC will achieve criminal success👼🇺🇸	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1	1	0
